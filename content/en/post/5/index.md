In the small, forgotten village of Eldershade, silence was more than just an absence of sound—it was a presence. The villagers had grown accustomed to the eerie quiet that draped over the town like a heavy fog, but none dared to speak of the whispers that occasionally broke the stillness. They weren't voices of the living, nor the wind's gentle hum, but something far more ancient.

One night, young Elara stood at the edge of the forest, her heart pounding in sync with the soft rustling of leaves. The whispers came again, this time clearer, more insistent. She couldn't understand the words, but their tone was unmistakable—a call, a beckoning from deep within the woods. 

Despite the fear gripping her chest, Elara took a step forward, drawn by a force she couldn't explain. The village had warned her, as they had warned all children, never to venture beyond the last stone marker. But the whispers were different tonight; they felt personal, directed at her alone.

As she ventured deeper into the forest, the trees seemed to close in around her, their branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The air grew colder, and the ground beneath her feet felt unnaturally soft, as though the earth itself was shifting. 

And then, as suddenly as they began, the whispers stopped. Elara found herself in a small clearing, bathed in the pale light of the moon. At its center stood an ancient stone, covered in strange, glowing runes. She stepped closer, her hand reaching out to touch it, when a voice—louder than before—echoed in her mind.

"Welcome, Elara. We've been waiting for you."

The forest fell silent once more, but this time, the silence felt alive.
