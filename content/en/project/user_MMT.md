## Key Work Items

### JWT Authentication and Authorization Mechanism Implementation
- Implemented seamless sharing of login tokens between web and app.
- Differentiated storage methods for access tokens and refresh tokens (localStorage and HTTP-only Cookie).
- Set JWT expiration to 30 minutes and stored refresh tokens in Redis memory for frequent access.

### Ongoing Development of Writing Page
- Currently developing the writing page based on Google Formâ€™s existing questions.
- Completed design for post listing and detailed view pages.

### User Access Control via Spring Security and JWT
- Applied user access control using Spring Security and JWT.
- Completed testing to ensure application security.

### SMTP Server Setup
- Implemented an email authentication system using Google SMTP protocol for registration and password recovery.
- Sent verification codes for identity confirmation during signup and for password recovery.

### Database Design for Real-Time Chat
- Completed the design of the database, excluding the message table, for real-time chat implementation.
- Ensuring the relational database design adheres to at least the third normal form (3NF).

### GCP Server Setup Completed
- Set up reverse proxy, database servers, and others using Docker containers on GCP.
- Designed with future integration possibilities for local servers in mind.

### Real-Time Notification System using SSE
- Completed the code for the real-time notification system using the SSE protocol.
- Currently improving system efficiency by integrating Redis PUB/SUB functionality.
