## Overview
This project involved developing a robot pathfinding program using Bee-up, C, and Arduino. The robot navigates a defined environment, making real-time decisions to find the optimal path to its destination.

## Technologies
- Bee-up
- C
- Arduino

## Key Features
- Pathfinding algorithm implementation
- Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Optimal path calculation
- Integration with Arduino for physical movement control
